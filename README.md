The title is Automated Visitor Segmentation and Targeting.

The aim is to use historical visitor data to recommend visitor segments of the website that uses it. The preprocessing and clustering are to be done automatically via a pipeline, and the only input required is the (json or csv) file from the user.

The main process is handled in the JsonProcessor.py file.
